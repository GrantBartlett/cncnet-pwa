# CnCNet PWA  
An experimental and work in progress Progressive Web App using the CnCNet ladder API as a data source.

## Project Aim
To create a fully working PWA prototype. 
It will be developed in TypeScript, with the idea to move to including React if it develops further to a site.

## Proof of concept works

## Next steps
After a quick test, I'll be looking to the next part of the project. 
Adding in React, and making it to eventually replace the ladder.cncnet.org frontend.
